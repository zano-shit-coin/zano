## They still can not save password properly

**They still can not save password properly for users!**  
Come on, it was July 17, 2019, and they have been developing this project for over six months.  
Six month passed, they even do not have the ability to save the password well for user.  
How could they claim their blockchain is Secure!

Said by their cofunder&core dev(Andrey Sabelnikov, Zuller Miller) :  

"we a re getting complains from some users(most of the users don't have this problem) that they have issues with master password. If you probably saw that on the start you providing master password and then use it to re-open all opened wallets. So people complaining(at first we thought it's just an idiots who forgot their passwords, but now it's clear that there is a problem) so they complains that sometime after applications got locked (which happens after app was idle for some time) master password is not accepted. Backend (we call C++ part backend here) is not involved in this process. Also there was complains that master password is not accepted after GUI was stopped and then opeened again. I'm not sure that you can reproduce it, but can you please review the code related with master password and see if you can figure out why it's happening sometime."
